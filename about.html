    Recent MBA (Summer 2020) with 10+ years of professional career in global mega corporations, currently in another master’s program for Data Analysis and Visualization (exp. Fall 2022). Passionate about leveraging data skills and discipline in statistical analytics while being able to bring business administrative/managerial experience to another level.

    <div id="about-me">
      <p>
<br>
         Initially, my focus in my M.B.A. journey was Digital Marketing, and through Digital Marketing courseworks, I became more interested in extending my knowledge in data analysis as I started analyzing marketing data in numerical approximation.</p>  
      
         <p>During Covid19 pandemic that pushed us to instant uncertainty for normalcy, I decided to pursue another master's degree in Data Analysis and Visualization program at CUNY Graduate Center from Fall 2020.  I am glad I made that choice -- I am enjoying exploring new analystic models in statistical methods and visualization techniques that enable to solve real world problems here in NYC, which I believe is a great competitive advantage to lead the world of innovation and development.
      </p>
      <p>***</p>

      <p> Prior to receiving a college degree, I had more than ten years of extensive experience working in an international environment at top finance companies (i.e. Bloomberg, Citi, Bank of America Merrill Lynch etc.) and I consequently earned B.Sc. degree in Finance/Economics at CUNY Medgar Evers College where I successfully brought my previous experience into academic setting. My undergrad experience at Medgar devoloped the foundation of my perception not only in scientific approaches and methodologies, but also in the social contexts and values through literatures of Audre Lorde or philosophy of Angela Davis, to name a few. </p>

      <p> I was fortunate to have been able to work in such big corporations with only high school diploma that led me to where I am today.  It was made possible because in my early career, I had always loved challenges and did not hesitate to knock on the door to the new stages.  The spirit lives on in me still, with much more skills added during the journey, and I am ready to contribute my rich experience and create something awesome with you.</p>

        I've been serving fortune 500 foreign invested firms for nearly 15 years and <strong>Sho</strong>ko was one of my candida<strong>t</strong>es from the professional network I established. 
​
        <p>I had a client seeking a candidate for a niche and not well known area of specialty. Basically, my search and introduction was at zero! However, Shoko picked up the book, picked up the knowledge in 1 month, and filled that opening. </p>

        <p>I highly recommend Shoko's ability on picking up on new things, and 'do-it' attitude for true innovative leadership.  I am confident that she will be a big asset to your firm, in this fast paced market! <span>"</span>

      <strong>Sho</strong>ko has been an indispensable par<strong>t</strong> of the Graduate Student Assembly since she joined our team a year ago. Internally, she created a structure for sharing organizational and financial documents. Externally, she recruited a team of dedicated grad students to help her build our first independent website, a monthly student newspaper with updates on student life, and documented social events. She did this all despite the many bureaucratic obstacles that come with working at a public college, which only proves her resilience to accomplish any goal she has set for herself. Through her hard work, we were able to create a greater sense of community among graduate students.<span>"</span>

      <strong>Sho</strong>ko is a hardworking and driven and can accomplish any<strong>t</strong>hing she sets her mind to get things done! I have known Shoko since Fall 2020 as we’re both students in the MS Data Analysis and Visualization (DAV) program at the CUNY Graduate Center—first as a fellow student and then as a fellow student committee representative.</p>

      <p>During that time, the DAV program was pretty new, so DAV students did not formally have a voice in Doctoral and Graduate Student Council (DGSC) student government. Therefore, Shoko took the initiative of getting enough signatures to ensure that DAV students could have a voice and became one of the first student committee representatives on the Executive (2020-2021) and Faculty (2021-2022) committees.</p>
      
      <p>Furthermore, she created a student-only Slack channel so that other DAV students can intermingle with one another about whatever is on their minds. Considering that the CUNY Graduate Center has been mostly remote from 2020 to now, it’s not easy to build student and faculty engagement. I respect and admire Shoko’s resiliency and determination to make things work under these circumstances.<span>"</span>
